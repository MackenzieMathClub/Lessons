\section{Introduction to the Riemann Hypothesis}
\begin{namedframe}{The \$\num{1000000} question}
	\begin{definition}[The Clay Mathematics Institute]
		``The nontrivial zeros of $\zeta(s)$ have real part equal to $\frac{1}{2}$.
	\end{definition}

\begin{namedframe}{Why does this matter?}
	If the Riemann hypothesis is true, then we are able to prove properties about the distribution of prime numbers.
	\sep
	It is considered to the \alert{most important open problem} in pure mathematics.
	\sep
	Most people assume it is true.
	If proved false, it would disrupt the field of number theory.
	\sep
	We will not be solving the Riemann hypothesis today.
