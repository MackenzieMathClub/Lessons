Lessons for the math club.

Thank you to the [CEMC](http://cemc.math.uwaterloo.ca/) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/) for being fantastic resources for our research.

And a special thanks to the CEMC's [Euclid eWorkshop](https://cemc.math.uwaterloo.ca/contests/euclid_eWorkshop.html), which our Euclid preparation lessons are heavily based off of.
