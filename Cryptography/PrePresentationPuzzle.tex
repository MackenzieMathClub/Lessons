\begin{frame}{A puzzle}
	\emph{Alice} and \emph{Bob} are trying to send each other a message without \emph{Eve the Eavesdropper} being able to read it.
	\vertspace
	There are some positive integers in each column. \emph{Only Alice} can access the numbers in her column. \emph{Only Bob} can access the numbers in his column. \emph{Anyone} can access the numbers in the \alert{public} column.
	\begin{columns}
		\begin{column}{0.2\textwidth}
			\begin{block}{Alice}
				\centering
				$a$

				$a$ is between $1$ and $n$.
			\end{block}
		\end{column}
		\begin{column}{0.4\textwidth}
			\begin{alertblock}{Public}
				\centering
				$g$ \hspace{2em} $n$

				$g$ is a small prime number.

				$n$ is a \emph{very} big number.
			\end{alertblock}
		\end{column}
		\begin{column}{0.2\textwidth}
			\begin{block}{Bob}
				\centering
				$b$

				$b$ is between $1$ and $n$.
			\end{block}
		\end{column}
	\end{columns}
	If Eve can read anything Alice and Bob send to each other, how can Alice and Bob both know a number without Eve knowing that number as well?
