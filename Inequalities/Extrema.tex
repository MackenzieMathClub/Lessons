\section{Extrema}
\begin{namedframe}{Extrema and Inequalities}
	Extrema (Minima and Maxima) are closely related with inequalities.
	\begin{exampleblock}{Minimum Case}
		If $f(x) \geq c$, where $c$ is some constant, what is the minimum value of $f(x)$?
	\end{exampleblock}
	\pause
	\begin{block}{Solution}
		The minimum value of $f(x)$ is $c$. \\
		\textbf{Proof:} \\
		Suppose the minimum value of $f(x)$ is less than $c$. This contradicts the inequality. \\
		Suppose the minimum value of $f(x)$ is more than $c$. This cannot be true because $c$ is less than this value.

	\begin{exampleblock}{Maximum Case}
		If $f(x) \leq c$, where $c$ is some constant, what is the maximum value of $f(x)$?

	\begin{block}{Soltion}
		The maximum value of $f(x)$ is $c$. \\

		Suppose the maximum value of $f(x)$ is more than $c$. This contradicts the inequality. \\
