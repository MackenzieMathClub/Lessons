\subsection{Examples}
\begin{namedframe}{Odd Number Squared}
	\begin{example}
		Given an integer $N$, prove that $N^2$ must be even, or one greater than even.*	
	\end{example}
	\pause
	This problem can be solved non-constructively. Simply noting that every number is either even, or one greater than even (odd), proves that this must be true. This is a nonconstructive proof because you proved the statement without finding the exact answer. A better example follows.

\begin{namedframe}{Irrational to the Irrational}
	\begin{example}
		Prove that it is possible to have an irrational number to the power of another irrational number result in a rational number.
	\end{example}
	\pause
	Recall that $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational. Let us consider two cases: $\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}$ and $(\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}})^{\sqrt{2}}$. \sep If the first case is rational, then we have found an example to match the statement.\sep If it is not rational, it must be irrational. This is the exhaustive part.\pause However, simplifying the second case allows one to see that the result is 2.\sep One of the two cases must be an irrational to the power of an irrational resulting in a rational. However, the specific one is unknown. This is the nonconstructive part.
