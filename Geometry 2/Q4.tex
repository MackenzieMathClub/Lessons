In a newly built park, there will be a permanently placed rotating sprayer in order to irrigate the lawns. Determine the largest radius of the circle which can be irrigated by sprayer $P$, so not to spray park visitors on line $AB$. Distance $AB = \SI{55}{\m}$, $AP = \SI{36}{\m}$ and $BP = \SI{28}{\m}$.
