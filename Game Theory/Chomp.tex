	\begin{namedframe}{What's the game?}
		Chomp is played on a rectangular grid, such as squares of a candy bar.
		The lower left square is considered \alert{poison}.
		Players take turns picking a square.
		With each choice, all squares above and to the right of the picked square are no longer available -- they are eaten.
		The person forced to take the \alert{poison} square loses.

		Yes!
		\begin{itemize}[<+(1)->]
			\item The first player has a winning strategy for any finite grid.
				\begin{itemize}
					\item They can take any move that the second can player can make, that would result in winning.
					\begin{itemize}
						\item We can think of this as strategy stealing!

	\begin{namedframe}{What is the winning strategy?}
		\begin{itemize}[<+->]
			\item Does anyone know one right away?
			\item No!
			\item Let's analyze some cases!

	\begin{namedframe}{$n \times n$ grid}
		\begin{itemize}[<+->]
			\item What's the strategy here?
			\item Make an ``L'', and then take symmetrical moves!

	\begin{namedframe}{$2 \times n$ grid}
		\begin{itemize}[<+->]
			\item What's the strategy here?
			\item Make sure that player 2 encounters a rectangle\ldots{} with a square missing!

	\begin{namedframe}{What is the winning strategy?}
		\begin{itemize}[<+(1)->]
			\item Just because there is always a winning strategy for player 1 doesn't mean that we know what it is!
			\item We know the strategy for $n \times n$ and $2 \times n$, as well as particular small grids\ldots{} but not all\ldots
			\begin{itemize}
				\item In 2002, Steven Byrnes (a high school senior!!) solved the $3 \times n$ case and won over $\$100\,000$
				\item Computers can calculate winning moves for grids of reasonable size
